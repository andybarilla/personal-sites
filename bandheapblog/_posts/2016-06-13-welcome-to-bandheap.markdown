Bandheap is a new project I've been working on for the past couple
weeks. This blog will be about the ins and outs and behind the scenes
knowledge I can share with the community.

Bandheap is starting out as a basic concert calendar site that aims to
make it easier to find concerts and events in your town. It pulls this
information from various sources on the Internet to minimize the need
for bands to duplicate the entry.

Stay tuned!
