## About

After years of searching for like-minded musicians, the founding members of The Rhythm Ratz came together to create their unique sound influenced by a wide variety of artists including Elvis Presley, Eddie Cochran, Johnny Cash, Social Distortion, and Mad Sin. Bringing their punked-up rockabilly and psychobilly sound to Colorado Springs, CO, The Rhythm Ratz are determined to drag this killer sound, popular in many other areas of the world, to Colorado. They’re heading into the studio in 2016 and play up and down the I-25 Colorado corridor. The driving guitar of Bryan Barcelon mixed with the slapping of Andy Barilla’s upright bass lay nicely over Mike Argo’s backbeat. Throw The Stray Cats and The Ramones into a blender, top with some pomade and leather jackets and you’ll get the perfect recipe for an energy fueled show.
